Combining schemas
=================

JSON Schema includes a few keywords for combining schemas together.
Note that this doesn't necessarily mean combining schemas from
multiple files or JSON trees, though these facilities help to enable
that and are described in `structuring`.  Combining schemas may be as
simple as allowing a value to be validated against multiple criteria
at the same time.

For example, in the following schema, the ``anyOf`` keyword is used to
say that the given value may be valid against any of the given
subschemas.  The first subschema requires a string with maximum
length 5. The second subschema requires a number with a minimum value
of 0.  As long as a value validates against *either* of these schemas,
it is considered valid against the entire combined schema.

.. schema_example::
    {
      "anyOf": [
        { "type": "string", "maxLength": 5 },
        { "type": "number", "minimum": 0 }
      ]
    }
    --
    "short"
    --X
    "too long"
    --
    12
    --X
    -5

The keywords used to combine schemas are:

- `allOf`: Must be valid against *all* of the subschemas
- `anyOf`: Must be valid against *any* of the subschemas
- `oneOf`: Must be valid against *exactly one* of the subschemas

All of these keywords must be set to an array, where each item is a
schema.

In addition, there is:

- `not`: Must *not* be valid against the given schema

.. index::
   single: allOf
   single: combining schemas; allOf

.. _allOf:

allOf
-----

To validate against ``allOf``, the given data must be valid against all
of the given subschemas.

.. schema_example::
    {
      "allOf": [
        { "type": "string" },
        { "maxLength": 5 }
      ]
    }
    --
    "short"
    --X
    "too long"

Note that it's quite easy to create schemas that are logical
impossibilities with ``allOf``.  The following example creates a schema
that won't validate against anything (since something may not be both
a string and a number at the same time):

.. schema_example::
    {
      "allOf": [
        { "type": "string" },
        { "type": "number" }
      ]
    }
    --X
    "No way"
    --X
    -1

.. index::
   single: anyOf
   single: combining schemas; anyOf

.. _anyOf:

anyOf
-----

To validate against ``anyOf``, the given data must be valid against any
(one or more) of the given subschemas.

.. schema_example::
   {
     "anyOf": [
       { "type": "string" },
       { "type": "number" }
     ]
   }
   --
   "Yes"
   --
   42
   --X
   { "Not a": "string or number" }

.. index::
   single: oneOf
   single: combining schemas; oneOf

.. _oneOf:

oneOf
-----

To validate against ``oneOf``, the given data must be valid against
exactly one of the given subschemas.

.. schema_example::
    {
      "oneOf": [
        { "type": "number", "multipleOf": 5 },
        { "type": "number", "multipleOf": 3 }
      ]
    }
    --
    10
    --
    9
    --X
    // Not a multiple of either 5 or 3.
    2
    --X
    // Multiple of *both* 5 and 3 is rejected.
    15

Note that it's possible to "factor" out the common parts of the
subschemas.  The following schema is equivalent to the one above:

.. schema_example::
    {
      "type": "number",
      "oneOf": [
        { "multipleOf": 5 },
        { "multipleOf": 3 }
      ]
    }

   single: combining schemas; not

.. _not:


not
---

This doesn't strictly combine schemas, but it belongs in this chapter
along with other things that help to modify the effect of schemas in
some way.  The ``not`` keyword declares that a instance validates if
it doesn't validate against the given subschema.

For example, the following schema validates against anything that is
not a string:

.. schema_example::
    { "not": { "type": "string" } }
    --
    42
    --
    { "key": "value" }
    --X
    "I am a string"
